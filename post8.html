            <p><b>Why the Name Change?</b></p>
            <p>Nova Networks served us well as a short-term placeholder; a name used for general branding in our beginnings. It never reflected where were going or what were trying to build. As we expand beyond a single server into a studio of ideas, it’s time for something more distinct, scalable, and creative.</p>

            <p>That’s why we’re now called <b>BYTE Play</b>—a name built for the future, just like the games we create.</p>

            <br>

            <p><b>What does BYTE Play mean?</b></p>
            <p>At BYTE Play, we’re crafting worlds <b>one byte at a time</b>. It’s a tenure to both digital design and the playful spirit behind everything we build. Whether it’s bite-sized minigames or expansive survival realms, we believe in quality, creativity, and connection.</p>

            <p>As we grow, so will the brand—<b>BYTE Play</b> is only the beginning. One day, we might just be known as <b>BYTE</b>.</p>

            <br>

            <p><b>What changes for you?</b></p>
            <p>Nothing, really—except everything gets cooler. You’ll still see all your favorite servers but now with more polish, better ideas, and a bigger vision behind them. Expect more updates, more innovation, and more fun.</p>

            <br>
                
             <p><b>When will this happen?</b></p>
            <p>It'll be a slow, but gradual process that starts today. So far, we've rebranded this website and the webstore. Our recently launched game Fertilia also displays this new branding.</p>
