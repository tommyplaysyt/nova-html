                <h2>Update Schedule</h2>
<p>If you were active around Fertilia earlier this year, you might have noticed a message explaining why the project went quiet for several months. There were multiple factors that led to this pause, including the need to reassess the server’s direction and ensure that future updates would be sustainable and meaningful for the community.</p> <p>Moving forward, our goal is to maintain Fertilia for the long term, which means creating a server that can thrive without burnout or rushed content. A key part of this plan is establishing a consistent, sustainable update schedule. After Christmas Event Part 1 and 2, we are aiming to release updates every fortnight, giving us regular, predictable windows to introduce new content while still keeping the quality high.</p> <p>This schedule allows us ample time between content drops to focus on critical fixes, optimize server performance, and address player feedback. It also gives me a much-needed break from constant development, which helps prevent mistakes and ensures each update is well-tested before it reaches you.</p> <p>By taking this approach, we can deliver features that are polished, stable, and enjoyable from day one. Players can look forward to updates that feel complete and carefully crafted, rather than rushed or incomplete, further aligning with our goals at <b>BYTE Play.</b></p> <p>On top of this, we’re excited to officially welcome our new Community Manager, Morgy (@morgmang)! Morgy’s role is to actively engage with the community, keep our Discord lively, and strengthen communication between me, Tommy, as the developer, and all of you as the players. With Morgy onboard, we hope to make community discussions more responsive, fun, and meaningful, giving everyone a stronger voice in the direction of Fertilia.</p> <p>We’re incredibly excited for this next chapter and can’t wait for you all to experience the updates we’ve been working on. The future of Fertilia is looking brighter than ever, and we’re committed to building something that’s not just fun in the short term, but sustainable and thriving for years to come.</p>
